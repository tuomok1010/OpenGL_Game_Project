# OpenGL_Game_Project

My first openGL game project. A simple platformer game.

This was made with visual studio 2019 and as far as I am aware does not work right off the bat with previous versions.
Also the solution platform must be x86.

The purpose of this project was to teach myself OpenGL. <b> This project is no longer developed! </b>
